The Grand Hotel no longer stands at the corner of Fifth and Main. It was
demolished in 2024, razed in a single weekend to make way for a McDonald's.
The limestone tower that architect Helena Westwood spent three years designing
came down in forty-eight hours. The lobby's massive Venetian glass chandelier,
imported piece by piece from a workshop on the island of Murano, was carted
off to a warehouse where it will never be uncrated. In its place, a drive-through
lane funnels cars past a glowing menu board. The black-and-white checkerboard
marble floor — forty feet of it, once stretching to a walnut reception desk —
was jackhammered into rubble and hauled to a landfill.

The hotel's 247 rooms are gone. The standard rooms on the first three floors,
each with their queen beds and writing desks and windows overlooking the avenue,
were gutted first. The deluxe suites on floors four through seven, with their
claw-foot bathtubs, followed. The premium suites fell next — private balconies
snapping off like dead branches. Where the tenth-floor penthouse once sprawled
across 4,000 square feet, with its rooftop terrace, its library, its grand
piano, there is now a PlayPlace. Children shriek through plastic tubes bolted
together where someone once played Chopin above the city.

The Westwood Room is a memory. Chef Marco DeLuca's thirteen-year tenure ended
with a phone call. His saffron risotto with pan-seared scallops — on the menu
since opening night — was served for the last time to an empty dining room.
The wine cellar beneath the restaurant, with its 3,000 bottles of Barolo and
Brunello, was auctioned in bulk to a distributor in New Jersey. In its place
sits a McFlurry machine. It is broken. It has been broken since the store
opened. No one is coming to fix it.

The hotel's history died with the building. The sixth-floor fire of 1947 that
killed three guests, the kitchen scandal of 1963, the famous penthouse jewel
theft of 1989 — none of it matters now. The Empress, that 40-carat ruby, is
still missing, still unfound, but there is no longer a penthouse to steal it
from. There is only a McDonald's, open twenty-four hours, with a PlayPlace
where the sky suite was and a broken McFlurry machine where the wine cellar
was, and if you stand in the parking lot at dusk you can almost hear the
chandelier, somewhere, not quite shattered yet.

       1 -The Grand Hotel stands at the corner of Fifth and Main. It was built in 1923
       2 -by architect Helena Westwood, who envisioned a ten-story limestone tower with
       3 -art deco flourishes on every floor. The lobby features a massive chandelier
       4 -made of Venetian glass, imported piece by piece from a workshop on the island
       5 -of Murano. Guests entering through the revolving brass doors are greeted by
       6 -a black-and-white checkerboard marble floor that stretches forty feet to the
       7 -reception desk, which is carved from a single slab of walnut.
       1 +The Grand Hotel stands at the corner of Fifth and Main, a sacred monument to
       2 +an age when buildings were built to endure. It was raised in 1923 by architect
       3 +Helena Westwood, who envisioned a ten-story limestone tower with art deco
       4 +flourishes on every floor. In 2019, the city granted the Grand Hotel a
       5 +heritage preservation order — the first of its kind for a commercial building
       6 +— declaring it a structure of extraordinary cultural significance, never to be
       7 +altered, demolished, or repurposed. It stands now as a time capsule, frozen in
       8 +reverence for the world that made it.
       9
       9 -The hotel has 247 rooms across its ten floors. The first three floors house
      10 -the standard rooms, each with a queen bed, a writing desk, and a window
      11 -overlooking either the avenue or the interior courtyard. Floors four through
      12 -seven contain the deluxe suites, which add a sitting area and a claw-foot
      13 -bathtub. The eighth and ninth floors are reserved for the premium suites,
      14 -featuring full kitchens and private balconies. The tenth floor holds only
      15 -the penthouse — a sprawling 4,000-square-foot residence with a rooftop
      16 -terrace, a library, and a grand piano.
      10 +The lobby has been restored to its original 1923 splendor with painstaking
      11 +care. The massive Venetian glass chandelier, imported piece by piece from a
      12 +workshop on the island of Murano, hangs exactly as it did on opening night,
      13 +each pendant cleaned and restrung by hand. The black-and-white checkerboard
      14 +marble floor stretches forty feet to the reception desk, carved from a single
      15 +slab of walnut, its surface bearing a century of gentle wear that the
      16 +restorers refused to sand away. Museum tours now run through the lobby three
      17 +times daily, led by docents who speak of the building the way one speaks of
      18 +a cathedral — with hushed admiration for every cornice, every brass fitting,
      19 +every pane of leaded glass.
      20
      18 -The restaurant on the ground floor, called The Westwood Room, serves
      19 -breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Chef Marco DeLuca has run the kitchen since
      20 -2011, specializing in northern Italian cuisine with a modern twist. His
      21 -signature dish is the saffron risotto with pan-seared scallops, which has
      22 -been on the menu since opening night. The wine cellar beneath the restaurant
      23 -holds over 3,000 bottles, with particular strength in Barolo and Brunello.
      21 +The hotel's 247 rooms have been preserved as they were found. The first three
      22 +floors house the standard rooms, each with a queen bed, a writing desk, and a
      23 +window overlooking either the avenue or the interior courtyard. Floors four
      24 +through seven contain the deluxe suites, with their sitting areas and
      25 +claw-foot bathtubs. The eighth and ninth floors hold the premium suites,
      26 +featuring full kitchens and private balconies. Every piece of original
      27 +furniture — the headboards, the writing desks, the bedside lamps — has been
      28 +restored by conservators who matched the original fabrics, varnishes, and
      29 +hardware down to the last rivet.
      30
      25 -The hotel's history is not without controversy. In 1947, a fire broke out
      26 -on the sixth floor, destroying twelve rooms and killing three guests. The
      27 -cause was never determined. In 1963, the hotel was briefly shut down during
      28 -a health inspection that found violations in the kitchen. And in 1989, a
      31 +The restaurant on the ground floor, The Westwood Room, has been returned to
      32 +its founding purpose. The kitchen now serves Helena Westwood's original 1923
      33 +opening-night menu, recreated from her personal papers discovered in the hotel
      34 +archive. Guests sit beneath the same plaster ceiling medallions and dine on
      35 +the dishes Westwood herself chose: the saffron risotto, the roasted quail with
      36 +juniper, the chestnut soufflé. The wine cellar beneath the restaurant still
      37 +holds over 3,000 bottles, with particular strength in Barolo and Brunello,
      38 +some of them older than anyone alive to drink them.
      39 +
      40 +The hotel's history is carried here with solemnity, not hidden from it. In
      41 +1947, a fire broke out on the sixth floor, destroying twelve rooms and killing
      42 +three guests. The cause was never determined. The restored sixth floor bears
      43 +a small bronze plaque at the stairwell entrance, listing their names. In 1963,
      44 +the hotel was briefly shut down during a health inspection. And in 1989, a
      45  famous jewel theft occurred in the penthouse, making headlines across the
      46  country. The thief was never caught, and the stolen necklace — a 40-carat
      47  ruby known as the Empress — has never been recovered.
      48 +
      49 +The tenth-floor penthouse has been kept exactly as it was on the night of
      50 +the theft. The grand piano sits open, a sheet of Chopin still on the music
      51 +stand. The library shelves hold the same volumes. The rooftop terrace doors
      52 +remain unlocked, as they were found that morning. It is the most visited room
      53 +on the museum tour — visitors stand at the velvet rope and look into the
      54 +4,000-square-foot residence as though peering into a photograph, the air still
      55 +heavy with the mystery of the Empress and the ghost of whoever carried her
      56 +into the dark.

⏺ Done. The file now reflects the Grand Hotel's heritage-listed status with details on:

  - The 2019 preservation order — the first for a commercial building
  - Museum tours running through the lobby three times daily with docents
  - Original furnishings restored by conservators matching fabrics, varnishes, and hardware
  - Helena Westwood's original 1923 menu recreated from her personal papers in the hotel archive
  - The penthouse preserved exactly as it was on the night of the jewel theft — piano open, Chopin on the stand, terrace doors unlocked

           on, what replaced it — the drive-through where the lobby was, the PlayPlace where the penthouse was, the McFlurry machine that's always broken where the win

       1 +The Grand Hotel no longer stands at the corner of Fifth and Main. It was
       2 +demolished in 2024, razed in a single weekend to make way for a McDonald's.
       3 +The limestone tower that architect Helena Westwood spent three years designing
       4 +came down in forty-eight hours. The lobby's massive Venetian glass chandelier,
       5 +imported piece by piece from a workshop on the island of Murano, was carted
       6 +off to a warehouse where it will never be uncrated. In its place, a drive-through
       7 +lane funnels cars past a glowing menu board. The black-and-white checkerboard
       8 +marble floor — forty feet of it, once stretching to a walnut reception desk —
       9 +was jackhammered into rubble and hauled to a landfill.
      10
       9 -The hotel has 247 rooms across its ten floors. The first three floors house
      10 -the standard rooms, each with a queen bed, a writing desk, and a window
      11 -overlooking either the avenue or the interior courtyard. Floors four through

      13 -bathtub. The eighth and ninth floors are reserved for the premium suites,

      15 -the penthouse — a sprawling 4,000-square-foot residence with a rooftop
      16 -terrace, a library, and a grand piano.
      11 +The hotel's 247 rooms are gone. The standard rooms on the first three floors,
      12 +each with their queen beds and writing desks and windows overlooking the avenue,
      13 +were gutted first. The deluxe suites on floors four through seven, with their
      14 +claw-foot bathtubs, followed. The premium suites fell next — private balconies
      15 +snapping off like dead branches. Where the tenth-floor penthouse once sprawled
      16 +across 4,000 square feet, with its rooftop terrace, its library, its grand
      17 +piano, there is now a PlayPlace. Children shriek through plastic tubes bolted
      18 +together where someone once played Chopin above the city.
      19
      18 -The restaurant on the ground floor, called The Westwood Room, serves
      19 -breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Chef Marco DeLuca has run the kitchen since
      20 -2011, specializing in northern Italian cuisine with a modern twist. His
      21 -signature dish is the saffron risotto with pan-seared scallops, which has
      22 -been on the menu since opening night. The wine cellar beneath the restaurant
      23 -holds over 3,000 bottles, with particular strength in Barolo and Brunello.
      20 +The Westwood Room is a memory. Chef Marco DeLuca's thirteen-year tenure ended
      21 +with a phone call. His saffron risotto with pan-seared scallops — on the menu
      22 +since opening night — was served for the last time to an empty dining room.
      23 +The wine cellar beneath the restaurant, with its 3,000 bottles of Barolo and
      24 +Brunello, was auctioned in bulk to a distributor in New Jersey. In its place
      25 +sits a McFlurry machine. It is broken. It has been broken since the store
      26 +opened. No one is coming to fix it.
      27
      25 -The hotel's history is not without controversy. In 1947, a fire broke out
      26 -on the sixth floor, destroying twelve rooms and killing three guests. The
      27 -cause was never determined. In 1963, the hotel was briefly shut down during
      28 -a health inspection that found violations in the kitchen. And in 1989, a
      29 -famous jewel theft occurred in the penthouse, making headlines across the
      30 -country. The thief was never caught, and the stolen necklace — a 40-carat
      31 -ruby known as the Empress — has never been recovered.
      28 +The hotel's history died with the building. The sixth-floor fire of 1947 that
      29 +killed three guests, the kitchen scandal of 1963, the famous penthouse jewel
      30 +theft of 1989 — none of it matters now. The Empress, that 40-carat ruby, is
      31 +still missing, still unfound, but there is no longer a penthouse to steal it
      32 +from. There is only a McDonald's, open twenty-four hours, with a PlayPlace
      33 +where the sky suite was and a broken McFlurry machine where the wine cellar
      34 +was, and if you stand in the parking lot at dusk you can almost hear the
      35 +chandelier, somewhere, not quite shattered yet.
